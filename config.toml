# LocalWispr Configuration

[model]
# Whisper model to use: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v2, large-v3
name = "large-v3"

# Device: cuda (GPU) or cpu
device = "cuda"

# Compute type: float16 (GPU), int8 (CPU), or float32
compute_type = "float16"

[hotkeys]
# Recording activation mode:
#   "push-to-talk" - Hold keys to record, release to stop and transcribe
#   "toggle" - Press once to start recording, press again to stop and transcribe
mode = "push-to-talk"

# Modifier key combination to activate recording
# Available modifiers: "win", "ctrl", "shift", "alt"
# Default: Win+Ctrl+Shift (unlikely to conflict with other applications)
modifiers = ["win", "ctrl", "shift"]

# Alternative for enterprise/managed environments where Win key may be restricted:
# modifiers = ["ctrl", "alt", "shift"]

# Play audio feedback sounds when recording starts/stops
audio_feedback = true

# Privacy note: LocalWispr only monitors modifier key states for hotkey detection.
# No keystroke logging occurs - regular typing is never captured or recorded.
