"""GUI tests for LocalWispr.

These tests use pywinauto to test GUI interactions.
They require the application to be running or use mock windows.

Note: GUI tests are excluded from the build gate by default
since they require a display and running application.
Run manually with: pytest tests/gui/ -v
