# LocalWispr Configuration (TEST VERSION)
# Uses Ctrl+Alt+Shift hotkey (no Win key) to run alongside stable version

[model]
# Whisper model to use: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v2, large-v3
name = "large-v3"

# Device: cuda (GPU) or cpu
device = "cuda"

# Compute type: float16 (GPU), int8 (CPU), or float32
compute_type = "float16"

# Language: auto (auto-detect), en, es, fr, de, it, pt, nl, ru, zh, ja, ko
language = "auto"

[hotkeys]
# Recording activation mode:
#   "push-to-talk" - Hold keys to record, release to stop and transcribe
#   "toggle" - Press once to start recording, press again to stop and transcribe
mode = "toggle"

# Modifier key combination to activate recording
# TEST VERSION: Uses Ctrl+Alt+Shift (different from stable Win+Ctrl+Shift)
modifiers = ["ctrl", "alt", "shift"]

# Play audio feedback sounds when recording starts/stops
audio_feedback = false

# Privacy note: LocalWispr only monitors modifier key states for hotkey detection.
# No keystroke logging occurs - regular typing is never captured or recorded.

[output]
# Auto-paste after transcription (or clipboard-only)
auto_paste = true

# Delay before paste to ensure focus (milliseconds)
paste_delay_ms = 50

[streaming]
# Enable streaming transcription for faster processing of long recordings
# When enabled, audio is transcribed in segments during recording
enabled = false

# Minimum silence duration (ms) before triggering segment transcription
# Higher = more accurate (fewer segments, more context per transcription)
min_silence_ms = 800

# Maximum segment duration (seconds) before forced transcription
max_segment_duration = 20.0

# Minimum segment duration (seconds) - avoid tiny fragments
min_segment_duration = 2.0

# Audio overlap between segments (ms) for better context
overlap_ms = 100

# Context detection settings for streaming mode
# Check context every N segments (detects if coding/planning/general)
context_check_interval = 3

# Lock context after N segments (stops re-checking)
context_lock_threshold = 4

# Or lock context after N words, whichever comes first
